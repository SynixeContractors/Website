            <p>
                As another year comes to a close, I am grateful to everyone that joined us in contracts, and for the
                memories we have created together. I am looking forward to entering the next year with you all.
            </p>
            <h2>Donations</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to thank everyone that has donated to Synixe, both in the past and now.
                Your contributions make what we do possible. In 2021 significant changes were made
                to our servers and hosted services, and we received a new group of donors.
                I am very grateful and am excited to continue to increase what we are
                able to accomplish.
            </p>
            <h2>2022 Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                In 2022 we want to refocus on maintaining a high standard of play. Our deaths
                and unrecoverable bodies were much high in 2021 than in 2020. In our 2021
                survery, the majority of members said they want to see a more serious tone
                during briefings and debriefings. We want to continue to aim for a 
                "serious fun" environment, encouraging our mission makers to
                build rich missions, and leadership roles to take pride in thier
                outcomes.
            </p>
            <h2>Winter Campaign & Reset</h2>
            <p>
                We'll be kicking off 2022 with a reset and a winter campaign. The decision to
                reset was not an easy one, but we will be going into 2022 with a fresh slate
                and additional features in out PMC system. Our new SOP, which will be released
                in the next few weeks, will outline new guidelines for managing your bank account.
                We will be keeping our current starting balance of $3,500 and equipment costs, but
                we'll be slightly increasing the payouts for contracts. Other features added
                to the PMC include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle tracking</li>
                    <li>Money transfers between players</li>
                    <li>Locker tracking</li>
                    <li>Caching (faster to open the shop)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I will see you all in Napf!
            </p>
