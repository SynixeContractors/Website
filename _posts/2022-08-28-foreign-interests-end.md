During the Foreign Interests theatre, Synixe Contractors saw itself under the employment of Daltgreen Mining & Exploration Ltd., a multinational mining company.

After Sefrou-Ramal elected a new president, resulting in a more democratic government being established, the UNA was deployed to assist in the transition. After the change in leadership, multinationals started to settle in the country and took the lead in the industrialization process of the country, angering a group of insurgents who decided to take matters into their own hands.

When insurgents opened fire on the workers of a Daltgreen mine and proceeded to bomb it the multinational decided to hire Synixe Contractors to provide security and logistics services to secure all industrial endeavors in the area.

Synixe's efforts ultimately resulted in success because since we left the region, Daltgreen has continued to operate in the country without any further problems and Sefrou Ramal's economy and industry are steadily progressing.
